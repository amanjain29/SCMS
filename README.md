# Supply Chain Management System

This is a project to implement Supply Chain Management System using Corda.
The states have 2 parties: Sender and the Receiver, along with the location where the exchange of products took place, and a unique identity associated with each transaction.
Contract has been designed to issue new products. The flows determine an efficient way in which the product moves in a supply chain.
